### [May 2017: JSConfEU](https://2017.jsconf.eu/)
> Want to know how JavaScript engines work? Why is JavaScript so fast? What is just-in-time compilation? We’ll look at basic concepts of compilers, challenges posed by modern JavaScript, and how to write compiler-friendly JavaScript.  ([Slides](https://fhinkel.github.io/JSEngines-HowDoTheyEven/JSConfEU/))

### [January 2017: Script 17](https://youtu.be/j6LfSlg8Fig)

> Do you care about performance? Memory leaks, megamorphic cache misses, and deoptimizations can slow your app down. We’ll dive deep into the inner workings of V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine, to better understand what these terms mean.  V8 ships with its own profiling tools that can identify such problems. You’ll learn to identify and fix low-level JavaScript performance issues using several V8 developer tools. ([Slides](https://fhinkel.github.io/PerformanceProfiling))
