### September 2017: BlinkOn

Lightning talk: Type Profile in V8

### July 2017: JSChannel

[Julian Sara Joseph](https://medium.com/@jsj14) summarized my talk [in this post](https://medium.com/@jsj14/js-channel-2017-b9e517e27a92).

### June 2017: Dinosaur JS

### June 2017: Web Rebels

### May 2017: JSConfEU

I like the longer version at JSChannel better. But with this video, you get the same content in half the time!

> Want to know how JavaScript engines work? Why is JavaScript so fast? What is just-in-time compilation? We’ll look at basic concepts of compilers, challenges posed by modern JavaScript, and how to write compiler-friendly JavaScript.  ([Slides](https://fhinkel.github.io/JSEngines-HowDoTheyEven/JSConfEU/))

### January 2017: Script 17

> Do you care about performance? Memory leaks, megamorphic cache misses, and deoptimizations can slow your app down. We’ll dive deep into the inner workings of V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine, to better understand what these terms mean.  V8 ships with its own profiling tools that can identify such problems. You’ll learn to identify and fix low-level JavaScript performance issues using several V8 developer tools. ([Slides](https://fhinkel.github.io/PerformanceProfiling))
 
> Franziska Hinkelmann of the Google V8 team gave a very detailed talk about Performance Debugging of V8, explaining what the errors shown in the Chrome Profiler mean. It was an incredibly deep-tech talk but insightful. Franziska made sure to point out that optimising your code for the performance tricks of one JavaScript engine is not a good idea and gave ChakraCore several shout-outs.  — [Christian

> This talks was one of my personal highlights since she dared to go really technical in her talk which is a thing that happens way to rarely at tech conferences IMHO. — [Wolfang Ziegler](https://wolfgang-ziegler.com/blog/script17)
